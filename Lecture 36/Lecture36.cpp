//Algorithms

//Algorithms are the procedure which are having different approaches to calculate 
//or solve any problem in a better or efficient way

//Correct use of algorithm leads to less time complexity as the problems get complexed the time also increses so we need better alogorithm

//there are different types of algorithm like
//1.searching,sorting, recursion, dp,gready and many more
