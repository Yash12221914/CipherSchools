//Upper Bound
//The upper bound of an algorithm's running time is a limit that the algorithm will not exceed for any input size. It is often represented using Big O notation (O). This notation provides an upper limit on the growth rate of the running time or space requirement of the algorithm.

//Lower Bound
//The lower bound indicates the minimum running time or space requirement that an algorithm will take for any input size. It is represented using Big Ω (Omega) notation (Ω). This notation provides a lower limit on the growth rate of the running time or space requirement.

//Big O Notation
//Big O notation describes the upper bound of an algorithm's complexity, giving the worst-case scenario of its performance. It provides a way to classify algorithms based on their growth rates relative to input size. For example, O(n) describes a linear growth rate, O(n²) describes a quadratic growth rate, and O(log n) describes a logarithmic growth rate. This notation helps compare the efficiency of different algorithms by focusing on their scalability.

//Example
//O(1): Constant time
//O(n): Linear time
//O(n²): Quadratic time
//O(log n): Logarithmic time
//O(n log n): Linearithmic time
//Understanding these concepts allows for the analysis and comparison of algorithms based on their efficiency and scalability.
