//Gready algorithms
//It is a way of approaching for a problem to get a solution in a greedy way
//In other words, Focusing on a particular instant to find a solution independent of what happen after

//Greedy algorithm repeatedly makes locally choice/decision
//They are often intutive, easy to understand and easy to implement
//However the problem is that in many situations we cannot solve a problem using a greedy approach
//Greedy solution is not necessarily best
