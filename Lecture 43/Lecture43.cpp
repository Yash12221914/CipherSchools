//Asymptotic analysis evaluates an algorithm's performance by describing its running time or space requirements in terms of input size,
// as it approaches infinity. It uses Big O notation to express the upper bound of an algorithm's complexity, 
//providing insights into its worst-case scenario. Other notations include Big Ω (omega), which represents the lower bound or best-case scenario,
// and Big Θ (theta), which describes the tight bound, or average case.
// Asymptotic analysis helps compare algorithms by focusing on their growth rates rather than exact timings, 
//enabling the selection of the most efficient algorithm for large input sizes.
