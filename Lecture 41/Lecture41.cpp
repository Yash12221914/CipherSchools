//Using algorithms efficiently requires selecting the appropriate algorithm based on the pr
//oblem's constraints and data characteristics. For large datasets, algorithms with lower 
//time complexities, such as quicksort or mergesort (O(n log n)), are preferable over simpler
// sorts like bubble or insertion sort (O(nÂ²)). Understanding the nature of the data is crucial; 
//for nearly sorted data, insertion sort can be efficient. Memory usage is another consideration; 
//in-place algorithms like quicksort minimize additional memory requirements. Additionally, optimizing algorithm imp
//lementation, leveraging data structures like heaps or balanced trees, and parallel processing can 
//further enhance efficiency and performance in various computational scenarios.
