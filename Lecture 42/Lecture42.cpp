//The number of times each line of the pseudo code runs maters
//implementation of logic remains the same

//for insertion sort
//compiler checks every iteration that j is greater than n or not
//all line takes c1n+c2(n-1)+c3(n-1) times

//There is concept of best case worst case and average case
//best case - it happens when there is minnum mumber of compiler checks for a solution and takes minimum time
//worst case - It happens  when there is maximum number of compiler checks for a solution and takes maximum time
